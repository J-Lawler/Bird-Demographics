Within the project folder, four subfolder should be created:

Data_Clean

Data_Raw

Models

Plots

The three data csvs should be placed in the Data_Raw folder.

The .r files should be run in order: 00, then each of the four 01 files, 02, then 03.

The Stan models C and D took about 3 hours to run on my machine.

Then the R markdown file can be run to produce the report.
